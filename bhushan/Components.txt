Angular Components 

1. Components are the most important and basic building blocks of Angular apps 

2. Authentication Module 
    - new-user 
    - login 
    - forgot-password
    - reset-password 

3. Component is a smallest functionality that you will implement in your application 

4. When we group multiple Components it becomes a module 

5. We can have paren-child relationship of components 

6. We can have components inside components 

7. Tree-herirachy of components 

    Dashboard 
        display-contact-list 
            contact-grid
                contact-import 
                contact-export  
            contact-options
            
8. lets create some custom components 
    ng g component add-contact 
    ng g component edit-contact
    ng g component list-contacts 
    ng g component delete-contact 

9. Every component has 4 files auto-generated with it 
    - component.html -> view or html or template file -> UI 
    - component.ts -> it will be a class file which will have methods -> Logic 
    - component.spec.ts -> It will have the unit test script for component 
    - component.scss -> stylesheet of the component 



10. Component decorator inside the component.ts file 

    selector -> unique identifier for the component
        -> id of the component 
        -> using this selector we will use the component  
    templateUrl -> your HTML code 
        - component.html file 
    styleURLS -> for linking your component stylesheet 
        - component.scss 
-------------------------------------------- Templates in Angular components 

1. whenever we generate a component 
    - 4 files 
        - template file ( .html )
        - style.scss ( stylesheet)
        - class (component.ts file )
        - spec ( unit test file)

2. This is totally based on the choice at installing Angular app 
    - if you selected scss 
    - if you selected css 
        style.css 

3. <comp_name>.component.html 
    - It works!

4. <comp_name>.component.ts file 

5. Decorator it gives definitinion and meaning to the 
    @ - it has prefix of @

6. by default Angular will add "app" as prefix 
    - selector -> "app-leads-listing" 
    - unique identifier to identify this component 
    - <app-leads-listing> 

        -> Can you change the default "app" prefix? 
            -> YES - we can change it throughout the app 
                -> "app" -> "MyfirstAngularApplication"
                -> angular.json -> change prefix 
        -> what will happen if i change? 
            -? Nothing happenns. Only thing you change, make sure you update with latest info
        -> will your app work or will it crash? 
            -> If you have updated the necessary components with latest prefix 

7. Templates in Components 

    - Two ways of using templates in Components 
        - templateUrl 
            - link the html file 

        - template 

    - templateUrl 
        -> is always 1 single html file 

    - template 
        -> we will pass the template itself instead of a html file 
        -> we just the HTML code that we want the component to display 
        -> we will use "backtick" and NOT single quote 
            backtick key can be found on left top side `
8. stylesURL 
    -> is an array 
    -> it can take multple stylesheets as input 
    -> it can be one or more stylesheets 

9. Hands-on examples 
    Profile -> Modules 
        list-profile -> component
